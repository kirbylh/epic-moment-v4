            <h1>The Miracle of Istanbul vs The "Hand of God"</h1>
            
            <p>
                <span>1. The Miracle of Istanbul - UEFA Champions League Final 2005:</span> <br>
                On May 25, 2005, at the Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, football 
                witnessed one of the most astonishing comebacks in its history. The UEFA Champions 
                League final between AC Milan and Liverpool FC will forever be remembered as 
                "The Miracle of Istanbul." <br>
                Jerzy Dudek, the Liverpool goalkeeper, emerged as the hero of the night. With a 
                series of acrobatic saves, including a memorable double-save against Andriy Shevchenko, 
                Dudek secured Liverpool's fifth European Cup title. The Miracle of Istanbul remains 
                etched in the hearts of football fans worldwide as a testament to the never-say-die 
                spirit that defines the sport.

                <span>2. The "Hand of God" and the Goal of the Century - FIFA World Cup 1986:</span> <br>
                The 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico witnessed perhaps the most iconic 
                individual performance in the history of the tournament. Argentinean legend 
                Diego Maradona single-handedly guided his team to glory, leaving an indelible 
                mark on the sport. <br>
                Just four minutes later, Maradona produced a moment of genius that showcased 
                his immense skill. Picking up the ball in his own half, he embarked on a mesmerizing 
                60-meter solo run, dribbling past five England players, before slotting the ball into 
                the net. This incredible solo effort, later known as the "Goal of the Century," 
                showcased Maradona's sublime talent and cemented his place in football history.
